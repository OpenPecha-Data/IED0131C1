	<h2>Instilling Confidence and Trust</h2>
<h3>An Inventory of the Sacred Contents of the Jarung Khashor StÅ«pa<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></h3>
<p><strong><em>by Tulku Rigdzin Pema</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Here is the story of the restoration of the marvelous support for the Enlightened Mindâ<br/>
A jewelled sun of wondrous compassion, through which the perfect Buddha lovingly cares for wandering beings,<br/>
And which sheds the light of much-needed benefit and happiness<br/>
Upon sentient beings and the Buddhaâs teachings.</em></p>
<p>In the past, once the great and glorious Heruka had wrathfully subdued Rudra, in the eight charnel grounds of the eight great lands of this worldâhome to the eight Mamosâthe eight great stÅ«pas, sources of siddhis, were erected. Furthermore, in eight great places of the noble land of India, eight stÅ«pas were erected to commemorate the eight great deeds of the perfect Buddha ÅÄkyamuni; in Uá¸á¸iyÄna, ViÅvakarma, the king of craftsmen, constructed the Glorious Unreachable á¸ÄkinÄ« StÅ«pa; and King AÅoka erected ten million stÅ«pas. Thus, there are innumerable stÅ«pas in this world.</p>
<p>What follows is a short presentation of the instructions found in the sÅ«tras and tantras on the construction of stÅ«pas that contain relics as their heart: </p>
<p>The <em>GuhyasamÄja</em> states:<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>StÅ«pas are said to be the palaces<br/>
Where all the buddhas reside. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A MantrayÄna tantra states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any aspiration made before stÅ«pas containing relics<br/>
Shall be accomplishedâthus has the TathÄgata praised them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The SÅ«tra of the Pure Stainless Light</em> states:<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past, in Kapila, the Blessed One said to the great brahmin Kapilacandra: âGreat brahmin, leave now. On the way to Kapila, at the junction of three roads, you will find an old stÅ«pa containing relics. Restore it and fill it with this secret mantra written on paper. Then make offerings to it and recite this secret mantra seven times. Doing so will prolong and lengthen your life. Also, after your death, you will be reborn in the higher realms and enjoy great wealth. And, in time, you will become a sacred object of veneration.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The SÅ«tra of The Marvelous Dharma Discourse</em> states:<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Änanda, in this trichiliocosm, if a devoted son or a daughter of noble family were to construct a stÅ«pa of the parinirvÄá¹a of the tathÄgata, the arhat, the fully awakened Buddha, the size of a myrobalan fruit, and if the were to insert a needle-sized life-tree within it, cover it with a juniper-leaf-sized umbrella, insert a statue the size of a grain of barley, and introduce a relic the size of a mustard seed into this stÅ«pa, then he or she would accumulate far more merit than is accrued through offering objects made of the seven precious materials to stream-enterers<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a>, to those who will return once, and to the Sangha of bhiká¹£us residing in the four directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These scriptures extensively explain how the process of filling inanimate statues and stÅ«pas is similar to the way consciousness enters an animate body. First, the five types of relics,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> the maá¹á¸alas, the life-trees and so on are inserted and installed within the statue or stÅ«pa. Second, a vajra-master who has the ten qualifying characteristics<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> invites the wisdom-deities.</p>
<p>This process can be verified both by sources of authority and reasoning. While all these practical instructions are hidden and scattered in the tantras, later on they were expounded by teachers possessing the eye of Dharma,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> such as the glorious protector NÄgÄrjuna, the great paá¹á¸ita Vimalamitra, the great paá¹á¸ita ÅÄntaraká¹£ita, and ÄcÄrya Jetari. These oral instructions were then transmitted uninterruptedly, like a chain of golden mountains, until they reached our own noble and glorious teachers. Relying upon the kindness of those who have maintained until today the practical instructions that clearly present the unmistaken tradition of these tantras, we have always performed the recitation of the Two Stainless Tantras,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> as much as required, before starting to construct more than a hundred stÅ«pas containing the maá¹á¸alas of the Two Stainless Tantras all over the world.</p>
<p>In Nepal, at the sacred site of the Lhundrup Tsek (âSpontaneous Moundâ) charnel ground, the Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa, the bestower of supreme and ordinary siddhis, suffered serious damage as a result of the 7.9-magnitude earthquake at 12pm on 25 April, 2015. As the restoration of the ancient stupa began, many of its relicsâthe life-tree and the rolled dhÄraá¹Ä«sâwere found rotten and severely damaged. In an effort to restore it to its initial state and to improve what was still in a good state, both I, Tulku Rigdzin Pema, and Sengdrak Tulku Ngawang Tengyal, closely followed the practical instructions on how to fill stÅ«pas with blessed objects.</p>
<h3>The Life-Tree</h3>
<p>On the 22nd day of the ninth month of the Tibetan year of the Wood Sheep (22 November, 2015), the juncture of the planets was auspicious. This day marked the occasion when, after spending the summer retreat in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and repaying the kindness of his mother, the blessed Lord of Sages descended from the heavens to the town of SÄá¹kÄÅya. Thus we chose to insert the life-tree on the morning of this very special day. </p>
<p>Following this, we gradually inserted the five types of relics:<br/>
On top of the life-tree, made from medicinal agarwood, we placed the âAll-Victorious StÅ«paâ.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> In this stÅ«paâs vase,<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> we inserted a wish-fulfilling jewel containing the precious relics of the Ngagyur tradition, one relic of the Buddha KÄÅyapa, and a few pieces of the bones of Buddha ÅÄkyamuni. On each side of the top of the life-tree, we placed the syllables of the five buddha families. At the five places we set syllables in the LaÃ±ja script<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> of the enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activities, all made in copper and covered with gold. On the remaining space of the life-tree, we inscribed in gold the essence, quintessence, secret mantras, vidyÄ-, and dhÄraá¹Ä«-mantras of the peaceful and wrathful yidam deities. On the three centers of the life-tree we placed: the body relic pill that develops magnificence, the samaya substance âEssence of the Sunâ; the speech relic pill that develops melodious speech, the samaya substance âMoon Nectarâ; the mind relic pill that develops great bliss, the samaya substance âBindu of the Four Joysâ; the âLiberation by Sight Cakraâ; and the âCakra of a Stable Life-Treeâ. Finally, the hundred mantras and dhÄraá¹Ä«s of Mindroling were all fastened to the life-tree. It was then covered with plastic and precious copper to make it waterproof before it was inserted into the stÅ«pa. </p>
<h3>1. DharmakÄya Relics</h3>
<p>For the main dharmakÄya relics, a large number of blessed <em>tsatsas</em><a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> had already been placed in the stÅ«pa.</p>
<h3>2. Dharma Relics</h3>
<p>We placed the five great dhÄraá¹Ä«s,<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> the hundred mantras and dhÄraá¹Ä«s compiled by the omniscient Mipham Rinpoche, including those of DharmakÄya AmitÄbha, Buddha ÅÄkyamuni, Buddha AmitÄyus, Guru Padmasambhava, Guru Drakpo, Guru Dorje DrolÃ¶, KÄ«la-VajrakumÄra, VajravidÄraá¹a, VajrapÄá¹i, MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, the vowels and consonants, and âThe Essence of Interdependent Originationâ. All these mantras were carved on more than two thousand leaves of precious copper using mechanical printing technologies and placed in forty-five copper caskets.</p>
<h3>3. Bodily Relics</h3>
<p>Authentic pieces of the bones of our Teacher, the fully awakened conqueror of the ÅÄkyas, and relic pills made of the bones of Buddha ÅÄkyamuni were placed inside the stÅ«pa.</p>

<p>Relic pills from the multiplication of the relics of the fully awakened buddha ÅÄkyamuni, a set of the âDifficult to Obtain in the Universeâ relic pills containing the four kinds of relic pills gathered by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, three authentic relics of the Buddha, relics of the âSeven Heroic Buddhasâ extracted as terma-treasures from the Kuchok Dechen Cave, and one relic of the Great TertÃ¶n Pema Lingpa were placed inside the stÅ«pa.</p>
<h3>5. Cloth Relics</h3>

<h3>Other Relics</h3>
<p>Nineteen copper boxes containing many special representations that were already in the stÅ«pa; the 1002 buddhas of this virtuous era, each measuring about six inches, that were located on the outer part of the decorations of the stupa; fifty statues of Guru Nangsi ZilnÃ¶n, about 366 copper sheets on which images of Guru Rinpoche and the Guru-Siddhi Mantra<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> were carved using the ancient techniques were inserted. Cakras according to the Lama GongdÃ¼, âThe United Intent of the Gurusâ, and Rinchen TerdzÃ¶, âThe Treasury of Precious Termasâ, that are for restoring the communities of the saá¹gha, for propagating the Secret MantrayÄna, developing the power of kings, increasing the population, expanding the family lineages of people with noble qualities, extending the lineages of profound teachings, increasing lifespan and wisdom, increasing wealth and possessions, restoring the strength and power of dralhas, appeasing grudges among gods and nÄgas, increasing fame and good reputation, restoring the earthâs essence, halting epidemics within countries, pacifying conflicts at different times, and generally increasing the splendor of the elements, the Bangle of Glory, the Cakra of the Life-Force of the VidhyÄdharas that increases perfection in the outer and inner worlds. The Cakras of the Lama KundÃ¼, âEmbodiment of the Gurusâ, Yidam KundÃ¼, âEmbodiment of the Yidam Deitiesâ, and Khandro KundÃ¼, âEmbodiment of the á¸ÄkinÄ«sâ, the Cakra of the wrathful Acala that protects from earthquakes, the Cakra that Liberates Cities, the SitÄtapatrÄ Cakra, the Cakra of the Venerable TÄrÄâall of which were printed on sheets of precious copper and placed inside the stÅ«pa.</p>
<p>Thus, on October 17th, 2016, on the 16th day of the 8th month of the Tibetan Fire Monkey Year, the stupa was successfully filled with the relics mentioned above. The Great Guru has said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In future times, when representations of the body, speech and mind are built,<br/>
Their completion and consecration should occur at the same time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tantra also states:<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consecration of buddhas and other representations<br/>
Should be done according to the rituals.<br/>
The consecration ritual should not be meagre.<br/>
For this reason, one who desires siddhis<br/>
Should put forth all efforts and perform it meticulously. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this advice, abbots, tulkus, lamas and monastics of the glorious Sakya tradition performed consecration rituals for five days. Abbots, tulkus, lamas and monastics of the KagyÃ¼ tradition, protectors of all beings, performed consecration rituals for five days. Abbots, tulkus, lamas and monastics of the superior Geluk tradition performed consecration rituals for five days. From the Ngagyur Nyingma tradition, many abbots, tulkus and spiritual teachers performed consecration rituals for six days. </p>
<p>The benefits of consecration are described in the tantras. One tantra states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherever these representations are found,<br/>
Retinues and riches will gather like clouds,<br/>
Sons and family lines will greatly increase,<br/>
Fame and renown will extend throughout space,<br/>
Concentration and samÄdhi will increase,<br/>
And the capacity to greatly benefit beings will be acquired.<br/>
Oneâs conduct will be equal to that of the sugatas. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a link with the construction of such a special representation through any of oneâs three doors will bring great benefits. As it is stated in <em>The SÅ«tra of the Classification of Acts</em>:<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha said to the young brahmin DÄraka: âThere are eighteen benefits to constructing a stÅ«pa of the TathÄgata. Those eighteen are as follows: being reborn in a royal family, having a healthy body, being beautiful and pleasant to look at, being stable, being heard in the ten directions, speaking in prose and verse in such a way as to generate great interest, receiving offerings from gods and men, coming into possession of great wealth, swiftly and completely going beyond all suffering. These are the eighteen benefits of constructing stÅ«pas of the TathÄgata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The SÅ«tra of The White Lotus of Great Compassion</em> states:<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the north, in the city of Taká¹£aÅilÄ, there will appear a householder named Jaá¹­Änika. He will make offerings to my body and the ÅrÄvakas and construct a support containing sacred objects.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> A thousand aeons from now, during the aeon Bhadraá¹kara, in a perfectly arrayed world, he will become the buddha SamantÄvabhÄsa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoever approaches a stÅ«pa of the tathÄgatas with devotion and pure perception, makes prostrations and offerings, and circumambulates, will, in the present, have a long life, and, as a patron, will be stable in political rule. Ultimately, he will be relieved of suffering in the unsurpassable buddha-field of SukhÄvatÄ«. This is stated in <em>The SÅ«tra Requested by Prasenajit</em>:<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Offer whatever is desirable or affordable<br/>
To a stÅ«pa of the tathÄgatas.<br/>
Those making appropriate offerings will be free of stains,<br/>
They will gain the unsurpassable enlightenment that is beyond all suffering. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also said:<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ÅÄriputra, the one endowed with great wisdom,<br/>
Asked the following to the Teacher:<br/>
âWhat will be the result<br/>
Of circumambulating stÅ«pas?<br/>
O great leader of the supreme world,<br/>
Please tell me.â<br/>
The perfectly enlightened one, the supreme of all,<br/>
The Teacher, answered him, saying:<br/>
âI will show some of the qualities<br/>
Acquired by anyone who circumambulates a stÅ«pa.<br/>
By circumambulating a stÅ«pa,<br/>
You will become beautiful and pleasant to behold,<br/>
You will have a noble complexion and generate joy in all who see you,<br/>
You will gain and enjoy a vast quantity of wealth and pleasures.<br/>
By circumambulating a stÅ«pa,<br/>
You will become a great householder, born of a noble lineage,<br/>
You will be rich and have many resources,<br/>
You will possess wealth and grain.<br/>
By circumambulating a stÅ«pa,<br/>
You will obtain the fruits of the Four Noble Truths,<br/>
The faculties and the powers,<br/>
And the limbs of enlightenment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As these scriptures indicate, to construct a stÅ«pa with the relics of the tathÄgatas in its core and generate respect for it brings about all perfect qualities, both temporary and ultimate. The Omniscient Teacher himself enunciated as much not only once but time and again. Such a sublime support with all the sacred objects it contains, constructed in such an excellent way, combines in a single representation the gathering of everything wondrous in both saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a. Thus it shines forth as a much-needed cure, yielding benefit and happiness to the teachings and beings.</p>

<p>Tibetan scholars group together five classes of dhÄraá¹Ä«s, which are inserted as relics. JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul (1813-1899) explained that one kind of each of these five dhÄraá¹Ä«s must be inserted in every stÅ«pa together with the <em>SÅ«tra of the Pure Stainless Light</em>. These are: <em>Uá¹£á¹Ä«á¹£avijayÄ</em>, <em>Vimaloá¹£á¹Ä«á¹£a</em>, <em>GuhyadhÄtu</em>, <em>BodhigarbhÄlaá¹kÄralaká¹£a</em> and <em>PratÄ«tyasamutpÄdahá¹daya</em> (the Essence of Interdependent Origination). <a href="#fnref:15" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Zikhyim (<em>zi khyim</em>) is a loan word from Chinese; it is also called âliâ in Tibetan. Zikhyim mostly refers to a special alloy that consists of seven or more metals used for casting statues, bells and other precious ritual objects. Depending on the percentage of each metal the colour changes. It can also refer to native copper extracted from the earth. Both the alloy and the native copper are regarded as very precious and thus ritual objects made from Zikhyim are not usually gilded. <a href="#fnref:16" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
